        <p>The <?php echo $config->getInstitutionName() ?> website is a showcase for the APIs avaialble with the Sierra Library System Platform. When you visit our pages you see a variety of ways in which you can create web content and "plug it in" to your Sierra system.</p>

        <p>Below is a list of the specific Sierra APIs that we've employed and exactly how we've implemented them on this site.</p>
        <p><b>Note!</b>  This is NOT a complete list of available APIs. It's only those we've actually employed on this site. You can also review our <a href="https://<?php echo $config->getDB() ?>/iii/sierra-api/swagger/" target="_blank">complete documentation discussing the entire Sierra API suite.</a></p>

The items API is also used extensively throught the "My Account" pages in our implementation. In the case of checkouts or reading history the basic information we have about each entry is it's item ID. So when we get a list of items (patron checkouts for example) we then call the bib API to supplement the item information with bib data such as the item's title, author, etc.</td>
