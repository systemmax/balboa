# Balboa

Balboa University Library is a demo website maintained by the Innovative Interfaces Sales Engineering Team.  

You can find the working version at:  http://balboa.iiidiscovery.com

Balboa is a faux library website designed to showcase the capabilities of some of the Sierra APIs.  For a discussion of how we've implemented the APIs, go to the Balboa website and from the menu select:  Help > Sierra APIs

## Getting Started

Copy these files into a folder on your local workstation where you can use your favorite code editor to modify the HTML, CSS, Javascript and of course Php.

### Prerequisites

You'll probably want to have a working version of this website running on a web server somewhere.  We create a web and a subdomain for balboa.

### Installing

There's nothing really to install. 

You do, however, need to update the configuration settings.  Modify the settings in classes/config.php.  They're pretty well commented/documented so you should be able to figure it out.

Once you've updated config.php with your valid settings, then you can update the configuration through the UI by visiting the admin.php page.  You'll have to login as a valid Sierra user to be able to update the configuration through the UI.
